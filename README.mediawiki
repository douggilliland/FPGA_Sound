= FPGA Sound =

Make sound from an FPGA starting from first principles.

* Start with single note - Middle C
* Make waveforms, save builds
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/FPGA_Sound/tree/Square-Wave-Middle-C Square Wave Middle C build]
** Sine Wave

= Audio Filter / Scaler =

* FPGA has digital outputs, no analog, need scaler
** Line level output neeeds 1V p-p signals
** FPGA output is 3.3V
** Use "simple" voltage divider
* Need filter to remove higher frequency components for PWM
* Circuit is a Low Pass Filter, Output Scaler
** 3 resistors, 1 capacitor
