= FPGA Sound =

Make sound from an FPGA starting from first principles.

* Start with single note - Middle C
* Make waveforms, save builds
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/FPGA_Sound/tree/Square-Wave-Middle-C Square Wave Middle C build]
** [https://github.com/douggilliland/FPGA_Sound/tree/Sine-Wave-Middle-C Sine Wave Middle C build]

== Square Wave ==

*  FPGA clock is 50 MHz
* Divide by counter to get note
* Resources
** 42 Logic cells
** 20 Registers

== Sine Wave ==

*  FPGA clock is 50 MHz
* Prescale 50 MHz by 3 to get to 16.667 KHz
* 256 samples in the table - one full wave
* 256 clocks for PWM
* Produces 261.00 Hz
* Resources
** 174 Logic cells
** 28 Registers
